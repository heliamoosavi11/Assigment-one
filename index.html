<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Helia Moosavi, I’m 21 years old and I live in Sydney. I moved to Australia when I was 14 from Iran and very grateful to have created a new life in Australia! 
One of my favourite things to do is working out and feeling strong! The gym is my favourite place as I can take my mind off things and focus on myself! I also like to paint every now and then even though I might not be the best painter! 
I have two cats named Kitty and Pablo and I love them so much!! Surprisingly I used to not be a big fan of cats a couple of years but after adopting my cats my opinion has complete changed!

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My main interest about IT comes from my mother. She has her Masters in IT and ever since I was little, I have always been surrounded by new Technology. I remember when she was learning how to code, I would just sit behind and be so fascinated on how everything works behind the scenes!! I think IT is such a male dominated field so it’s very encouraging to see strong women in this field!! 
I have also been in IT recruitment for past 3 years and have slowly learnt about IT by speaking with people in the industry. My passion for IT grew stronger as I got work on various IT roles such as full stack developers, programmers, IOS developers and etc so I decided to take that next step and study IT myself. Not only I can have a career in IT myself once I finished my degree its also very beneficial for my recruiting role to know what my client’s needs are and what candidates I should be looking for.

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>My ideal job is the Cyber Threat Hunter opportunity at the department of home affairs. 
Having looked at the burning glass data my ideal job has not changed as this job is fascinating to me because I have been interested in IT and the law enforcement so to combine the two things, I’m most passionate about sounds very appealing to me. This job requires a high-level of attention and working with a broad number of different technologies. Also according to my own research Australia is suffering from a cyber security skills shortage.' This shortage provides a unique opportunity for cyber security students and demand for their skills and services will grow by at least 21% to May 2023. 

To be able to qualify for this job I will need to complete a Bachelor’s degree in IT and also complete a Masters in Cyber Security.

<h1>My Profile</h1>
<p>My Myers Briggs test has indicated that my personality type is a debater, I have also scored high on being an extrovert and intuitive which I think is an accurate observation of my personality. Im a very social person and I often like to get discuss controversial topics to undestand other people's point of views or educate people on topics that are not often spoken about.</p>

<p>The learning style test indicates that I'm a Visual Learner which is a 100% accurate, my learning style has always been via either watching videos, looking at pictures or learning by practice. In this test it also mentions that I can get easlity distracted by sounds which is not accurate as I can not do chores, work or study without a TV show or podcast running in the background .</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>My Project idea is a Buy now pay layer for alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks at bars and restaurants.Based on my research this Idea already exist for buying liquor by the bottle at liquor stores but not individual drinks on a night out.
This will be an app where people can purchase individual drinks by paying the ¼ of the amount upfront and the rest over a weekly payment plan.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Currently there are so many Buy now pay later options available for retail, electronics, flights and food but there has not been an option for liquor and alcohol Going for a night out could be very expensive and not everyone can afford to pay $20+ for one drink so this app allows individuals to enjoy their night on a budget friendly matter.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The way this app would work is by generating a barcoded voucher worth of $150. The individual is allowed to purchase 1 drink at once. Once the drinks are purchased there will be a timer set on the app for a waiting period of one hour to purchase the next drink. The timer allows the drinks consumed to be spaced out. There will also be a limit of 4 drinks per night as it is recommended by Australian health government that a healthy adult should only consume 4 drinks in one day.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>•iOS programming abilities in Swift
•Kotlin
•Jenkins, Artifactory, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Bitrise, intelliJ and Appcentre
.</p>

<h1>Outcome</h1>
<p>I think this app could be very successful as there has not been a payment plan system for alcoholic drinks.It can also be an affordable way for people to enjoy their nightlife without spending too much money at once. </p>
