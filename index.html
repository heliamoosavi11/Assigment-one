<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Helia Moosavi, I’m 21 years old and I live in Sydney. I moved to Australia when I was 14 from Iran and very grateful to have created a new life in Australia! 
One of my favourite things to do is working out and feeling strong! The gym is my favourite place as I can take my mind off things and focus on myself! I also like to paint every now and then even though I might not be the best painter! 
I have two cats named Kitty and Pablo and I love them so much!! Surprisingly I used to not be a big fan of cats a couple of years but after adopting my cats my opinion has complete changed!

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My main interest about IT comes from my mother. She has her Masters in IT and ever since I was little, I have always been surrounded by new Technology. I remember when she was learning how to code, I would just sit behind and be so fascinated on how everything works behind the scenes!! I think IT is such a male dominated field so it’s very encouraging to see strong women in this field!! 
I have also been in IT recruitment for past 3 years and have slowly learnt about IT by speaking with people in the industry. My passion for IT grew stronger as I got work on various IT roles such as full stack developers, programmers, IOS developers and etc so I decided to take that next step and study IT myself. Not only I can have a career in IT myself once I finished my degree its also very beneficial for my recruiting role to know what my client’s needs are and what candidates I should be looking for.

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>My ideal job is the Cyber Threat Hunter opportunity at the department of home affairs. 
Having looked at the burning glass data my ideal job has not changed as this job is fascinating to me because I have been interested in IT and the law enforcement so to combine the two things, I’m most passionate about sounds very appealing to me. This job requires a high-level of attention and working with a broad number of different technologies. Also according to my own research Australia is suffering from a cyber security skills shortage.' This shortage provides a unique opportunity for cyber security students and demand for their skills and services will grow by at least 21% to May 2023. 

To be able to qualify for this job I will need to complete a Bachelor’s degree in IT and also complete a Masters in Cyber Security.
