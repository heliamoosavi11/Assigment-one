<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Helia Moosavi, I’m 21 years old and I live in Sydney. I moved to Australia when I was 14 from Iran and very grateful to have created a new life in Australia! 
One of my favourite things to do is working out and feeling strong! The gym is my favourite place as I can take my mind off things and focus on myself! I also like to paint every now and then even though I might not be the best painter! 
I have two cats named Kitty and Pablo and I love them so much!! Surprisingly I used to not be a big fan of cats a couple of years but after adopting my cats my opinion has complete changed!

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My main interest about IT comes from my mother. She has her Masters in IT and ever since I was little, I have always been surrounded by new Technology. I remember when she was learning how to code, I would just sit behind and be so fascinated on how everything works behind the scenes!! I think IT is such a male dominated field so it’s very encouraging to see strong women in this field!! 
I have also been in IT recruitment for past 3 years and have slowly learnt about IT by speaking with people in the industry. My passion for IT grew stronger as I got work on various IT roles such as full stack developers, programmers, IOS developers and etc so I decided to take that next step and study IT myself. Not only I can have a career in IT myself once I finished my degree its also very beneficial for my recruiting role to know what my client’s needs are and what candidates I should be looking for.
